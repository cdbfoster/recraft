Currently, building is only supported using the Eclipse IDE <eclipse.org> on
Linux.  If you can provide building instructions for other environments/OSes,
please email me at <cdbfoster@gmail.com>.

To build/run the project:

1.	Create the project directory:
		$ mkdir recraft/
		$ cd recraft/

2.	Clone the repository (should now have recraft/recraft/):
		$ git clone git://github.com/cdbfoster/recraft.git

3.	Download the Eclipse project settings from:
		https://github.com/downloads/cdbfoster/recraft/eclipse_setup.zip
	and extract the eclipse_setup/ folder into recraft/ (the parent recraft/,
	not the repository)

4.	Start Eclipse and point the workspace prompt to eclipse_setup/.

5.	Click File > Import... and under General, select Existing Projects into Workspace.
	Click Next>.

6.	Click the green and white Run button at the top of the workspace.
