    Recraft: The Minecraft Restructure Project

    The goal of this project is to create a more moddable 
Minecraft without relying on a limited mod-API that hides
the insides of Minecraft -- Minecraft should be written as
an API into itself.  The Recraft project attempts to accomplish
this through an object-oriented design by implementing Minecraft
as a variety of objects communicating through common interfaces,
thus abstracting individual implementations.  The result is
a more easily extensible, maintainable program to serve as a
base for modding.

    Recraft's structure is inspired by PBRT (www.pbrt.org).

    Recraft is released under the GNU GPL.  Please see the
